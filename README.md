# UpSkill
Learning topics to better understand technologies. This repository will contain various parts
of software engineering from networking, to languages, to common tools. Some learning material
will be added retroactively and act as a refresher for myself in the future. The material for
each item will consist of at least some learning material in the form of markdown files, and
some may be supported by a project.

The intention behind the way things are written is to make it so someone with no previous knowledge
in a subject will be able to read and follow along with the material.

# Section 3 - Basic Networking Terms
- Network: Digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes, which are computing devices that
  use common telecommunications technology
- Network Interface Card (NIC): A card inserted into a computer that has a MAC address that acts as the identifier
  for the device it is attached to. The NIC sometimes has ethernat ports (RJ45). NIC's have come a long way and 
  can be used in USB ports.
- Modulation: The process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform with modulating signal that typically
  contains information to be transmitted
- Cat: Category of cable. In general, higher numbers represent faster speeds and higher frequencies
- Bus Network: A network in which every device is connected via a single, large cable. Very inconvenient.
- MAC Address (Media Access Control): A burnt in address that identifies the network interface card.
- Dynamic Host Control Protocol: A network management protocol used on IP networks where DHCP server dynamically assigns
  an IP address to each device on a network
- Repeaters: devices that retransmit signals so that they can go further or get around obstructions
- Hub: A multi port repeater
- Switch: a switch reads what is being sent in each frame and only forwards to the correct port
- Router: Interconnects between networks and allows us to map ethernet ports to wireless ports
- Firewalls: Many routers have built in firewalls, but you can also have a dedicated firewall.
- ISP: Internet service provider
- Access Points: Extend the range of wireless connectivity
- IDS: Intrusion Detension System. Warns you when there is an attack taking place on your network.
- IPS: Intrusion Prevention System. Warns and blocks an attack.

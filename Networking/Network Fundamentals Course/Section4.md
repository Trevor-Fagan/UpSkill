# Section 4 - TCP/IP Model
## OSI Model
Highly debated currently whether it is prevelant.
- 7 - Application
- 6 - Presentation
- 5 - Session
- 4 - Transport
- 3 - Network
- 2 - Data Link
- 1 - Physical
Often layers 5-7 are combined, which is referred to as the TCP/IP model. This is what
is is going to be used in the CCNA exam.

## TCP/IP Mapping
Application => Application
Segments => Transport
Packets => Network
Frames => Data link
Bits => Physical

## Terms
- Segments: A broken piece of a packet with a TCP header in each of them
- Packets: Routers route packets from one interface to another
- Frames: Switch from one port on a switch to another
- Bits: Electrically on or off on the wire
